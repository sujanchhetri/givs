                  Nepal has a typical monsoonal climate, with a dry season from October to
May and a wet season from June to September. The main monsoon is from
mid-June to September, and the very best times to visit are Autumn
(September to November) and Spring (March to May). Obviously climate
charts and temperature extremes differ across the country and
temperatures are much colder in the north, and warmer in th e south.
If you are coming in the winter, please bring warm clothing (think
layers), and cool, summer clothing is suitable for the remainder of
the year. If you are here during the monsoon, please bring a
waterproof jacket and an umbrella.

                  You are responsible for arranging your own visa for Nepal. All
foreigners, except Indians, must have a visa to enter the country.
Visitors to Nepal are allowed to stay on a tourist visa for up to a
maximum of 150 days (five months) per calendar year (January to
December). Please note that international volunteers who arrive in
August can work up to ten consecutive months, split across two
calendar years (i.e. August to May). Non-tourist visas are very
difficult to obtain.
You can obtain a multiple entry tourist visa from the Nepalese
Embassy in your home country or a single entry visa upon arrival
at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport or at road borders
(you will be asked to fill in an application form and provide a
passport photograph).
We recommend that you obtain your visa in your home country, as
it saves time and you can avoid the long (sometimes very long)
queues at the airport.
If you stay longer than the duration of your initial visa, you will need to
obtain a visa extension at the Immigration office in
Kathmandu or Pokhara.
Please note that your passport needs to have at least six months validity.

                  This will vary depending on the time of year in which you visit
Nepal and what additional activities you intend to participate in
during your stay in Nepal. It is also a good idea to bring with you a
photocopy of your passport and visa, and keep this in a separate
location to the original documents. If possible you should also
email yourself a scanned copy of important documents before departing
for Nepal, as this will facilitate things in the event of loss or theft of the
original documents.
